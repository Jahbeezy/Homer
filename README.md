# Homer

## Description
---
    For this project I was required to build a website from scratch including an 'about me' as well as display my work and contact info. This website will be the layout of an online resume showing my applied skills in html, css and soon enough java script. To create the site I had to lean and understand more advance css like how to use media queries and flex grid to resize the layout of my page to scale to multiple screen sizes.

## Installation
---
 To install the application go to https://github.com/Jahbeezy/Homer , copy the ssh key and clone the repository using your terminal.
 Launch from index.html

## Usage
---
The page provides a flexable design and responsive scaling features.
